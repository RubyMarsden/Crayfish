### Crayfish data reduction

Crayfish reduces data from SHRIMP .pd files. Within the /example_data folder there are three files, two example .pd
files which are utilised in the paper "A new approach to SHRIMP II zircon U-Th disequilibrium dating" and a whole rock
activity ratio spreadsheet (values from Marsden et al. 2021).

#### Using Crayfish

Import the chosen .pd file from the examples folder by selecting the 'Import .pd file' button. A series of pop-up
windows will follow, the standard samples are as follows: GJ, G4, R33, PL, P1 and should be selected as samples which
are in equilibrium.

When asked to input whole rock activity data into the next pop-up window the names of the samples SS15-45 is translated
to 545 within the .pd file and therefore within Crayfish. This is simply due to shortened spot names while working on
the SHRIMP II.

Following this stage the tabbed results window should be visible as outlined in "A new approach to SHRIMP II zircon U-Th
disequilibrium dating". Samples which have clear SBM variation can be removed and the background correction approach can
be selected at this stage.

If you are importing a file which does not work please add an issue to the github repository
[here](https://github.com/RubyMarsden/Crayfish/issues).
